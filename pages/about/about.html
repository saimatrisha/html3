		<b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</b> <i>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</i>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

      	   <b>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.</b> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <Mark>Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,</Mark> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<em> Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,</em> written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <small>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</small>

     	<em> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,</em> but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <dfn>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,</dfn> <strong>making this the first true generator on the Internet.</strong> It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated<cite> Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,</cite> <mark>injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</mark><br>
